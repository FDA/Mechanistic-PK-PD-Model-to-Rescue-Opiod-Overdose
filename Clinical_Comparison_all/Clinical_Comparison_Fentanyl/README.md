# Simulation of fentanyl clinical studies. 
The code combines the receptor binding model with PK models for fentanyl to simulate a clinical ventilation study for naive and chronic fentanyl users. IV fentanyl is described 
by a 3-compartment model. These models are combined with a mechanistic model linking fraction of fentanyl-bound receptor to ventilation to simulate respiratory depression 
following repeat IV fentanyl administration. The primary model output is percent of baseline ventilation. See ventilation response for [Naive](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opiod-Overdose/blob/main/Clinical_Comparison_all/Clinical_Comparison_Fentanyl/figs/Naive_IFV_justp4.pdf) and [Chronic](https://github.com/FDA/Mechanistic-PK-PD-Model-to-Rescue-Opiod-Overdose/blob/main/Clinical_Comparison_all/Clinical_Comparison_Fentanyl/figs/Chronic_IFV_justp4.pdf) users
