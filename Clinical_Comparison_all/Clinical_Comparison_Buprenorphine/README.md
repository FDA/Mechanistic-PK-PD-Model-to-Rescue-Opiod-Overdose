# Simulation of buprenorphine clinical studies. 
This code combines the receptor binding model with PK models for buprenorphine and naloxone to simulate a clinical ventilation study. IV buprenorphine is described by a 3-compartment model whereas IV naloxone is described by a 2-compartment model. These models are combined with a linear transduction model linking fraction of buprenorphine-bound receptor to ventilation to simulate respiratory depression following buprenorphine administration and reversal of depression after naloxone administration. The primary model output is percent of baseline ventilation.
